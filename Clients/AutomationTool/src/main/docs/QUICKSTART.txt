Running:
1) Edit config/opendrac.properties
2) In the bin directory are two shell scripts, one for windows (.bat) and one for unix (.sh).
   Both scripts allow for calling it from anywhere on the file system. 
   Once the PATH variable from your OS is extended with the path to the script you can call it anywhere.

opendrac.properties:
- scheduleName: Specify a name that will be used to identify the schedule.
- billingGroup: Specify the user group that is responsible for the creation of the light path.
- startTime: Specify a start time in this date time format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss 
- endTime: Specify a end time in this date time format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
- serviceDuration: Specify for how long the connection should last for.
- rate Specify: the speed in Mb/s (e.g. 1000 for 1Gb/s)
- sourceUserGroup: Specify the user group that the user belongs to at the source end point.
- sourceUserResourceGroup: Specify a resource group that the user has at the source end point.
- sourceEndpoint: Specify the source end point.
- destionationUserGroup: Specify the user group that the user belongs to at the destination end point.

Start and stop functionality;
For the start functionality recreates the service that starts now and lasts for the period as defined in the config file. 
It requires the following fields: sourceEndpoint, destinationEndpoint, rate, serviceDuration, scheduleName.

The stop functionality terminates a service defined by name, user and source and target endpoints from config file.


Simple mode in MS-Windows:
For ease of use three .cmd files were made to automate three command line options.
To put these into action the following steps should be taken:
Copy the three files from the directory "contrib/microsoft" to the place where they should be started from, e.g. the desktop
Go to the configuration screen to set the PATH variable:
Add to the end of the current value: ";<path_to_automation_tool>\bin" (substitute the right path for the variable between angles).
(Note: setting the PATH is also mentioned in item 2 of the paragraph "Running", see above)

If this is done double clicking the .cmd file will open a dos-shell. Feedback from the executed command is displayed in that shell.
